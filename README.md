### Stretch Tasks
*Only if there is time*
- [ ] connect secondary display
- [ ] implement secondary display for city
- [ ] allow user to control speed of simulation
- [ ] allow user to add cars, select destination, change road layout
- [ ] allow user to make slight modifications to the algorithm (such as how quickly it responds to changes in the environment)
- [ ] allow user to follow a vehicle
- [ ] pedestrian traffic
- [ ] non-controlled intersections (no traffic lights)
- [ ] accidents, road closures, weather
- [ ] drivers not following rules
- [ ] add option to model traffic based on time of day
